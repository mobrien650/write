### The Window

Outside my office building, flocks crowded sidewalks, overflowing into the streets with infectious energy, a stark contrast to the usual masses huddled deep in their coats during the New England winter. Groups sat on the steps of buildings eating lunch and food trucks lined the street, a break from their long slumber.

I ground my jaw while voices rambled about company goals, the topic of today’s lunch call. Laughter rose from the street and bounced against my window, taunting my capture. The entire world enjoyed the first warmth of spring and I was a prisoner to the drab ash walls of my office. 

Every bone in my body ached to join, but dark clouds sat on the horizon and threatened to smother the day’s new spirit.
In the distance, someone said my name, shredding my daydream. “Yes, the sales numbers are looking good for the quarter,” I shot into my headset. 

The warm spring air continued to beckon, but my boss would see me leave. He was a high school bully in a grown man’s pudgy, five foot body. If he was stuck on a call, I was too.

The call trudged on and my legs bounced with anxious energy. A dozen of my coworkers threw a frisbee around in the park across the street. I couldn’t wait any longer. Would the warmth endure after the storm, or would cold recapture the air?
The current speaker finished, leaving an awkward silence for anyone to speak. No one did.  I jabbed the end button on my phone and bolted to the elevator.

Its doors opened to the lobby, and outside rain plunged to the pavement. Everyone scattered for cover, running into buildings or down into the subway. I missed my window to enjoy the warmth. My coworkers carried the fresh smell of rain into the building and my pulse accelerated. I strode past them into the rain. It might not be what I hoped for, but I’d still enjoy the day.
