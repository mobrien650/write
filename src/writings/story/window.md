# The Window

Looking down from my office on the bustling scene outside, I contemplated how much I hated lunch calls. The entire world enjoyed the first warmth of spring and I was a prisoner to the drab ash walls of my office. Outside flocks of people crowded sidewalks, overflowing into the streets with infectious energy, a stark contrast to the normal masses huddled deep in their winter coats. 
My body ached to join them, but dark clouds sat on the horizon and threatened to smother the new spirit of the day before my call ended.

In the distance, someone said my name. It tore me away from my daydream and back to reality. “Yes, the sales numbers are looking good for the quarter,” I shot into my headset. The warm spring air continue to beckon me outside, but I knew I would never get past my boss without him seeing that I left the meeting.

The call trudged on, and I forced myself to listen as my legs bounced with a anxiousness to run free. The park across the street hosted a dozen of my co-workers throwing a frisbee around, a force that pulled at me to join.
I couldn’t wait any longer. Who knew if the warmth would endure after the storm, or if cold would capture the air again? I needed to be outside.

The current speaker wrapped up, leaving that awkward silence that lingers on the end of calls for anyone to speak, but no one does. I jabbed at the end button on my phone and bolted to the elevator.

The elevator’s doors opened to the lobby, outside rain plunged to the pavement. Everyone scattered and ran for cover, I missed my window to enjoy the warmth. My coworkers entered the building, carrying the smell of rain with them. The fresh smell renewed my desire to go outside. I strode past them into the rain. It might not be exactly what I was hoping for, but I could still enjoy the day.
